# ansible-playbook
A Handy Skeleton for Ansible Playbook Project

# The Stack
- Python2.7+
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool to setup and provision development environments.
- VirtualBox
- [Testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.org/) to run the tests
- [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) pacakge manager and setup virtualenv.
- [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/) to setup the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and run vagrant and testinfra.

# Install
1) Clone skeleton from GitHub.
```
git clone git@github.com:fsjohnhuang/ansible-playbook.git
```
2) Install pipenv.(Assuming Python2.7+ has installed)
```
pip install --user --upgrade pipenv
```
3) Install development denpendencies.
```
pipenv install --dev
```

# Ansible
## Ansible Project-Based Configuration


## Group and Host Vars
1. The `group_vars` and `host_vars` directories can exist in the playbook directory(i.e. `./src/` in this project) or the inventory directory(i.e. `./inventories` in this project). If both paths exist, variables in the playbook directory will override variables set in the inventory directory.
2. The `ansible-playbook` command looks for `group_vars` and `host_vars` in the playbook directory by default.
3. The `ansible` and `ansible-console` commands will only look for `group_vars` and `host_vars` in the inventory directory, unless you provide the `--playbook-dir` option on the command line.

*For keeping things in same pace, recommand placing `group_vars` and `host_vars` in the inventory directory strongly as this project has done.*

## Variables Merge Rules
The lowest to highest order is:
1. all group
2. parent group
3. child group
4. host

When groups of the same parent/child level are merged in alphabetical order, and the variables of last group loaded overwrites those of the previous groups.

### Sample
In inventory file

``` ini

[web]
x.x.x.x ansible_ssh_user="root" ansible_ssh_pass="root"

[prod-web:children]
web

[windows:children]
web
```

In `group_vars/prod-web.yml`

``` yaml
---
NAME: "prod-web"
FOR: "everyone"
```

In `group_vars/windows.yml`

``` yaml
---
NAME: "windows"
CONNECT: "winrm"
```

The final merged result is:

``` yaml
---
NAME: "prod-web"
FOR: "everyone"
CONNECT: "winrm"
```
